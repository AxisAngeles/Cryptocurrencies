# Cryptocurrencies

### **Purpose**

Using the cryptocurrencies data set, this next analysis evaluates features on the trading market to group each cryptocurrency into a more addressable classification system that should help possible investors in portafolio development.

#

### **Overview**
Overall, the analysis required some data cleansing and processing to develop some unsupervised machine learning clustering models.
* Data transformation and some scaling were required.
* Principal Components Analysis was run to analyze only the main variables.
* An "Elbow Curve" was plotted to define how many clusters should be considered.

### **Conclusion**
The model resulted in 4 different clusters based on the Algorithms and minning data for each coin.
